Powerline Components and Faults Dataset

https://huggingface.co/datasets/docmhvr/powerline-components-and-faults

This dataset contains images of powerline components and faults, intended for use in deep learning applications. The images can be analyzed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify powerline components (such as poles, transformers, and wires) and detect faults (like broken parts or damage). By training a model on this dataset, automated systems can assist in powerline maintenance and inspection by identifying and diagnosing issues quickly and efficiently.
