# Power-Fault-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Powerline Components and Faults Dataset

https://huggingface.co/datasets/docmhvr/powerline-components-and-faults

This dataset contains images of powerline components and faults, intended for use in deep learning applications. The images can be analyzed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify powerline components (such as poles, transformers, and wires) and detect faults (like broken parts or damage). By training a model on this dataset, automated systems can assist in powerline maintenance and inspection by identifying and diagnosing issues quickly and efficiently.

How to Use
Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that the dataset is structured with images and corresponding annotations for object detection.
Set Up the Model: The model is defined using a standard architecture, typically a pre-trained Faster R-CNN or another suitable model for object detection.
Run the Training: The training loop will run for the specified number of epochs. It utilizes a random 10% subset of the dataset for training.
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Run the Validation: After training, validate the model on a separate 10% subset of the dataset.
To run validation, execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
python validate.py
Key Features
Subset Training: The model trains on a random 10% subset of the dataset to manage computational load.
Progress Tracking: Training and validation loops display a progress bar with loss values for each batch, providing real-time feedback.
Evaluation: Separate validation logic is implemented to assess the model's performance on a validation set.
Custom Collate Function: Handles variable-sized images during batch processing.
Training Hyperparameters
Batch Size: 8
Epochs: 5 (can be adjusted)
Learning Rate: Adjustable within the training script
Future Improvements
Increase the dataset size for training and validation.
Optimize hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
Implement data augmentation for improved model generalization.
Fine-tune pre-trained models for better performance.
